zKonnect is a dApp that helps creators for creating token-gated events online where their fans can buy tickets directly from their favorite social for eg X and get cNFT of that event minted on demand onto their wallet address.
This cNFT will be used for token-gating of the event that the creator is hosting and the online event is happening in our platform itself using dRTC with **Huddle01**.
It uses **Huddle01SDK** for token-gated rooms and **Reclaim Protocol** to get a zk-proof of the number of followers of a creator.

zKonnect comes as an all around package for a creator, ie, from ticketing to hosting online events.

## Features

- **Decentralized Event Hosting**: Create and manage events on the Solana blockchain.
- **Seamless Payments**: Utilize Solana's fast and low-cost transactions for ticket purchases.
- **Blinks**: Use Blinks to share the event on your favorite social for your fans to buy tickets.
- **cNFT Ticketing**: Provide attendees with unique NFTs as event tickets and memorabilia.
- **Multi-token Payment**: Currently we give options for creators to accept payments in Sol, USDC, and are willing to expand more.
- **Audience Engagement**: Interactive features to enhance the event experience for attendees.
